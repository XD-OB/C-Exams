--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Write a program that takes one or more strings and, for each argument, puts 
the last character of each word (if it's a letter) in uppercase and the rest
in lowercase, then displays the result followed by a \n.

A word is a section of string delimited by spaces/tabs or the start/end of the
string. If a word has a single letter, it must be capitalized.

If there are no parameters, display \n.

Examples:

$> ./rstr_capitalizer | cat -e
$
$> ./rstr_capitalizer "a FiRSt LiTTlE TESt" | cat -e
A firsT littlE tesT$
$> ./rstr_capitalizer "SecONd teST A LITtle BiT   Moar comPLEX" "   But... This iS not THAT COMPLEX" "     Okay, this is the last 1239809147801 but not    the least    t" | cat -e
